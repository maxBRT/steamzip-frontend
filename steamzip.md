# Product Spec: SteamZip MVP

---

## 1. Vision
A high-speed utility for indie game developers to generate a full suite of Steam Store graphical assets from a single piece of high-resolution key art. The goal is to replace hours of manual cropping and resizing with a 60-second automated workflow.

---

## 2. Core Features

### High-Resolution Image Intake
* **Single Master Upload:** Support for a high-quality "Master" art file (recommended 3840x2160).
* **Instant Preview:** Visual representation of how the art fits into the three most critical Steam aspect ratios: Horizontal, Vertical, and Square.

### Smart-Crop Interface
* **Focal Point Selector:** A tool allowing the user to select the most important part of the image (e.g., a character) to ensure it remains centered across all auto-generated sizes.
* **Asset Verification:** Automatic checks to ensure the uploaded file meets the resolution requirements for a high-quality export.

### Automated Asset Generation
The system automatically generates a "Full Pack" consisting of 8+ distinct files, including:
* **Store Capsules:** Header, Small, Main, and Vertical variations.
* **Library Assets:** The "Box Art" (Library Capsule) and the wide Library Hero banner.
* **Store Branding:** The page background and community assets.

## 3. User Journey & Monetization

### The "Hook" (Free Tier)
* **Free Sample:** Users can upload their art and download a perfectly sized **Header Capsule** at no cost to verify the tool's quality.

### The "Full Pack" (Paid Tier 9$/pack)
* **One-Click Payment:** A seamless, one-time purchase to unlock the complete asset ZIP file.
* **Instant Fulfillment:** Immediate access to a downloadable `.zip` file containing every required asset, named exactly according to Steam’s technical documentation.

---

## 4. Operational Principles
* **Privacy First:** All uploaded art and generated packs are automatically deleted from the server after 24 hours.
* **Zero Friction:** No account creation or password management required to purchase or download. A user should only be prompted to pay once once all is ready to go.
